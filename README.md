# WarmupRepsCalc

5x5 warmup reps calculator for the big three compound movements.
Calculations are based on Dr. Mike Israetel of Renaissance Periodization's video titled "How to Warm Up for Muscle Growth Training | Hypertrophy Made Simple #3" (youtube.com/watch?v=HDq-68SlPgQ).
Don't be afraid to add in more warmup sets, if needed.

Need to add (in terms of priority):
1. Metric units
2. Add plates needed for each weight
3. Remember previous workouts
4. Add other exercises
5. Add UI
