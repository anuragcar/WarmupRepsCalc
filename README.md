5x5 warmup reps calculator for the big three compound movements.
Calculations are based on Dr. Mike Israetel of Renaissance Periodization's video titled "How to Warm Up for Muscle Growth Training | Hypertrophy Made Simple #3" (youtube.com/watch?v=HDq-68SlPgQ).
Don't be afraid to add in more warmup sets, if needed.

Need to add (in terms of priority):
1. Fix decimal points: plates needed for workout have .0's, and warmup reps drop the .5 when rounding to the nearest 2.5 place.
2. Add (JavaFX) UI.
3. Remember previous workouts.
